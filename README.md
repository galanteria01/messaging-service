# Messaging-service
A customer messaging service with the backend and frontend implementation



- Build a messaging app that can be used to respond to incoming questions sent by our customers. Assume that the messages are received from and sent to the Android app through an API endpoint which you can simulate via a simple web form
- Implement a canned message feature that allows agents to quickly respond to enquiries using a set of pre-configured stock messages.
- Implement search functionality to allow agents to search over incoming messages and / or customers
- Explore ways to surface additional information about customers (e.g. external profiles or some internal information we have about them) in the UI, to provide context to agents.
